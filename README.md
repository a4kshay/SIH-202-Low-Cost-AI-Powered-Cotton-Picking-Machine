# SIH-202-Low-Cost-AI-Powered-Cotton-Picking-Machine
Low-cost, AI-powered cotton picking machine for small and marginal farmers. A portable, battery/solar-powered device using OpenCV &amp; TensorFlow to selectively detect and pick mature cotton bolls with minimal trash content. Developed for Smart India Hackathon (MoA&amp;FW).

Problem Statement
Design and develop a low-cost, portable, and efficient cotton-picking machine that:
Operates in fragmented and uneven cotton fields
Is lightweight and single-person operable
Minimizes damage to cotton bolls and plants
Uses battery / solar power
Collects cotton with minimum trash content

Proposed Solution (Innovation)
We propose a compact, semi-automated cotton-picking device featuring:

🔹 AI-Powered Vision System
OpenCV + TensorFlow based model
Detects mature cotton bolls only
Reduces trash and improves cotton quality

🔹 Mechanical Cotton Picker
3D-printed spindle with soft hooks
Modular design for easy maintenance
Low RPM operation to prevent plant damage

🔹 Portable & Farmer-Friendly
Hand-held / push-type design

Lightweight body

Battery powered (solar-assisted optional)
